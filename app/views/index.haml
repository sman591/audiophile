          %p Every day, millions of people listen to music across the globe. However, not all music quality is shared alike. Certain people in the world, "Audiophiles" as they call themselves, strive for the upmost quality in the music they listen to.

            %h2 Source
            %p There are a variety of sources of which you can obtain to listen to music. To list a few:
            %ul
              %li Portable Devices (e.g, iPods)
              %li Digital Files (e.g, MP3, MP4, FLAC)
              %li Physical Media (e.g, CD or LP)
            %p However, one of the above is not like the other. Can you guess it?
            %p
              It's the LP. The LP is stored in Analog form, or more simiply,
              %i not digital.
              While Analog sources such as the LP offer the purest, closest-to-studio format, digital formats can vary.
            %p Different digital file formats, such as MP3 or FLAC, use different digial algorithms to reproduce the audio in analog form. Formats such as MP3 compress the audio data in order to reduce file size, however this compression comes at the sacrifice of quality.
            %p For this reason, Audiophiles prefer lossless (aka, no loss in quality) formats such as FLAC, though any LP would be preferred when possible.

          #factors-medium.factor-detail
            %h2 Medium
            %p Just as important as the source of the audio, sometimes even more important, is the medium of which the music is played through. This includes any sort of headphones or speakers that you may use to listen to music, plus the device that you play it out of.
            %p Just as a cheap bike likely won't get you too far, a cheap pair of headphones or audio player likely won't produce the best results for your music.
            %p For this reason, Audiophiles put a lot of effort into buying various headphones, speakers, and other audio devices to find what they feel produces the best results.
            %p High prices may not always mean the best of quality, but the cheap stuff likely won't do you any good.

          %h2 Community
          %p The audiophile community is vast, diverse, and growing. While it once was limited to those aiming to improve recorded audio, it now covers a large community more generally acceptable as "people who love sound."

          %p Go out and plug in that cheap pair of headphones. Listen to a song, then switch to a better pair of headphones or a full stereo system. Chances are that even without the "best" equipment, you'll notice a difference.
